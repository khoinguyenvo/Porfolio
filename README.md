### I. TICKETING PLATFORM DATA PIPELINES
#### 1. Background:
This is a project I did for a company specializing in online ticket sales, catering to sports and recreational events. While the initial database architecture effectively supported the platform's backend operations, this setup wasn't designed with analytical purposes in mind. Not only did data were stored scatteringly, but also the naming convention was a disaster. This lack of a standard data model hindered the company's ability to analyze the data and derive meaningful insights from it. 

**`In a nutshell, my mission was to reshape the data and make it usuable for analytics`**. 

#### 2. Objectives:
##### Objective 1: Put together an OLAP database, which: 
- stakeholders can run ad-hoc queries against.
- is the data source of the business dashboard.
- is the foundation to build a CRM system.
##### Objective 2: Build a business dashboard, which:
- tracks daily sales performace by monitoring sales KPIs and key financial metrics.
- presents an analysis of customers behaviour and segmentation.
  
#### 3. Approach:

#### 4. Technologies, Tools, and Frameworkes:
This project leverages a variety of open-source technologies (Dagster and dbt) and cloud services (GCP, AWS and Azure), with Python and SQL being the major programming languages. The final application is running on Docker to ensure scalability.
